      <h3>I ☕<u>love</u>☕ coffee.</h3>
      There are X different ways to brew coffee in my apartment!
      <br /><br />For the last 7 years I've been working for a startup as a
      software engineer. Before my next break-out role, I unfortunately, still
      have to pay bills.

      <h1>Work Experience</h1>
      <h2>
        ※ In 2017 I worked as a barista/bartender at The Hideout Coffeehouse.
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Being both a coffee shop, and improv theatre, at the heart of downtown
          Austin, there was a massive variety in our genres of patrons.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>※ From 2013-2017 I was a canvasser for Environment America.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This was primarily fundraisig door-to-door for a variety of
          environmental causes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Locations included Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, Seattle, Portland,
          Denver, and, of course, Austin. I knocked on at least 15,000 doors
          total.
        </li>
        <li>
          I helped run the Austin office as a director through 2016, recruiting,
          interviewing, hiring, and training staff. (On top of canvassing)
        </li>
        <li>
          Our teams managed to meet with Senators, investors, the press and
          other influencers as part of our campaign strategies.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Besides Work</h3>
      When I'm not working I'm playing video games, board games, and still
      coding.
      <br />A lot of this is out at patio bars and/or cafes. I love meeting new
      people, learning their stories, finding more life collaborators.
