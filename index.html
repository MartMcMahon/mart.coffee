      <h3>I ☕<u>love</u>☕ coffee.</h3>
      There are 6 different ways to brew coffee in my apartment!

        <li>
          Being both a coffee shop, and improv theatre, at the heart of downtown
          Austin, our customers were everything from office workers to
          celebrities. It feels great to meet regulars, get to know orders, and make drinks for people in my community.

      <h3>Besides Work</h3>
      When I'm not working, I'm playing video games, board games, and coding
      side projects.
      <br />A lot of this is out at patio bars and/or cafes. I love meeting new
      people, learning their stories, finding more life collaborators.
